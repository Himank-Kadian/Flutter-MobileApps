# App5

This app makes use of Google Firebase to store data to the cloud.
It contains a sign in page with basic user authentication.
User could log in or create a new user.
The user could create a list of TODO items which are saved to the cloud datastore.
Pulling a TODO item to the left allows the user to delete it.

Most of this app was provided by my instructor. I did not build it, I only made small changes.
