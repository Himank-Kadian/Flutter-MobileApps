# App2

This app uses a switch and two buttons. The switch on top can be toggled to enable the app's functionality. The red button has an initial state with text 'Click Me'. Clicking the red button changes its state and returns the number of times it has been clicked. Toggling the switch at this point would would not change the Red button's state, meaning it would still show the count. Clicking the blue Reset button resets the Red Button to its initial state of 'Click Me'.
